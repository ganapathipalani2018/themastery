Missing ESLint configuration files while CI expects proper linting setup\n2. Test scripts configured as placeholders but CI attempts to run actual tests\n3. Required development dependencies not installed (ESLint, Jest, testing libraries)\n4. Configuration files missing (.eslintrc, jest.config.js, etc.)\n5. Package.json scripts contain placeholder echo commands instead of actual tool executions\n\n### Specific Failure Points\n- Frontend CI pipeline fails on lint checks, test execution, and bundle analysis\n- Backend CI pipeline fails during linting, unit tests, and database integration tests\n- Code quality checks failing on security scans and dependency vulnerability checks\n- Deployment pipeline blocked due to upstream CI build failures\n\n### Required Actions\n1. Install all missing development dependencies in respective package.json files\n2. Create proper configuration files for ESLint, Jest, and other testing tools\n3. Replace all placeholder npm scripts with actual tool implementations\n4. Perform local verification of CI pipeline steps before pushing changes\n</info added on 2025-07-14T15:35:51.279Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-14T16:09:28.395Z>\n## GitHub Actions CI/CD Fixes Complete\n\nSuccessfully fixed all CI/CD pipeline issues:\n\n### Configuration Files Created:\n1.
